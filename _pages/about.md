I am an engineer with formal education in computer science, post-graduate from the University of Colorado, and graduate from Visvesvaraya Technological University. 

My area of research is in computer vision, machine learning, software development, and deployment. 

I currently solve crucial sensing problems of the parking industry and work on the development of revolutionary next-gen parking systems at Metropolis as a Computer Vision Application Engineer.
